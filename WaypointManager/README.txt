Unzip the files into the Tribes\config dir.  No other installation is necessary,
AutoLoad will find and load the script.  Don't forget to install ObjectiveTrak.

Now start tribes, go to the Options menu, then the Scripts menu, now select
Waypoint Manager from the pull down menu.  From here you can set various options
and get help.

Advanced: The file WaypointManager.avl.vol can be located anywhere under the
config dir.  eg: Tribes\config\Crunchy or Tribes\config\.
