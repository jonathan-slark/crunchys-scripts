# Crunchy's Scripts

## Overview

This repository is a curated collection of game mod scripts originally hosted on my website, [Crunchy's Scripts](https://web.archive.org/web/20010630081611/http://guides.barrysworld.com/tribes/scripts/scripts.shtml), dating back to 1999â€“2000. In today's terms, these would be known as mods. Each mod includes not only scripts but also GUI and BMP files, and every mod is organized into its own directory along with the original README files.

## Background

The mods in this repository are for [Starsiege: Tribes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starsiege%3A_Tribes), a pioneering game released in 1998 that was ahead of its time in terms of modding support. At that time, game modification was just beginning to gain traction, and Starsiege: Tribes became one of the early examples of a title offering extensive customization through scripting.

## Technical Details

Starsiege: Tribes utilized **TorqueScript**, a C-like scripting language that powered the Torque Game Engine (TGE). When Tribes was released in 1998, the engine was in its infancy compared to what would later evolve into the full-fledged Torque Game Engine. Originally developed by Dynamix, the engine was eventually licensed and open-sourced by GarageGames, paving the way for more robust modding and game development tools.

## Repository Structure

- **Individual Mod Directories:**  
  Each mod is contained within its own directory. Inside, you'll find the source code, along with additional assets such as GUI elements and BMP images.
  
- **Original READMEs:**  
  The original README files from each mod have been preserved to provide historical context and technical details as they were originally documented.

## Modern Context

By uploading these scripts to GitHub, I aim to preserve this early piece of game modding history and make it accessible for enthusiasts, historians, and developers interested in the evolution of modding and game scripting. While the methods and technologies have advanced significantly since then, these scripts offer insight into the pioneering days of game modifications.
