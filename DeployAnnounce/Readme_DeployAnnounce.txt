Installation
------------

Unzip the files into the Tribes\config dir.  No other installation is necessary,
AutoLoad will find and load the script.


Advanced Notes
--------------

The files can be put in any directory under Tribes\config.  For
instance you could put them in a Tribes\config\Crunchy directory if you wanted to
keep things tidy.
