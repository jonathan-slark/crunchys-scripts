Installation
------------

Unzip the files into the Tribes\config dir.  No other installation is necessary,
AutoLoad will find and load the script.

Now start tribes, go to the Options menu, then the Scripts menu, now select
Item HUD from the pull down menu.  From here you can set various options
and get help.


Advanced Notes
--------------

The files can be put in any directory under Tribes\config.  For
instance you could put them in a Tribes\config\Crunchy directory if you wanted to
keep things tidy.
